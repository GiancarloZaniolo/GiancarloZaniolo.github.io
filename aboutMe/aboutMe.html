    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Currently living in Pittsburgh, where I study Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>I enjoy mountain biking and playing soccer for fun. Sometimes, I also enjoy programming for fun.</p>

    <h2>What I can do</h2>
    <p>This probably gives a pretty good summary:<a href="linkedin.com/in/giancarlo-zaniolo-99656b22b/">Linkedin</a><br>
Much of my coursework and research involves low-level programming and/or computer architecture. I would place links to an OS, compiler, and RISC-V core that I wrote for classes here but that would be an academic integrity violation.</p>
