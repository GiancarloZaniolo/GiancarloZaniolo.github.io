    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I was born in Boca Raton, Florida, moved to Lexington, Massachussetts for middle and high school, and now live in Pittsburgh, where I study Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>My two main interests are mountain biking and programming. What I love most about the two is the satisfaction that you get after finally completing a goal that you work towards for a long time, whether it be hitting a jump after spending weeks building it, or finally getting a complicated algorithm to run.</p>

    <h2>What I can do</h2>
    <p>As for programming languages, I know C/C++, Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript, and am able to use Matlab. I am always willing to learn languages or frameworks to get a job done.</p>
