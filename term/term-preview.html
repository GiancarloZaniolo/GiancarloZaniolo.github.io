      <h1>Funny Oscilloscope Terminal</h1>

      <h4>This is the code for I used to make an arduino display up to 64 (legibly) or 256 (illegibly) characters on an Oscilloscope for CMU's 2024 Build18 Hackathon.<br>
Arduinos are probably worse than you may realize, and so this task involved several hacks and optimizations to get a working end result of displaying my laptop's terminal on the scope.<br>
As I don't have time right now, I won't detail the whole process here yet, but for anyone interested, the code for what I did exists.</h4>

      <h4>(By the way, even though it may not look like it, the oscilloscope picture is supposed to be saying "mux_commands.sh tmux_restore.sh >ls". It wasn't very easy making each ascii character look different when I only had 9 possible positions to "move the pen" for each character)</h4>
