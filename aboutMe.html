    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I was born in Boca Raton, Florida, and moved to Lexington, Massachussetts, where I live now. Both of my parents are from Brazil, where a large portion of my family lives, and I visit them every summer. I am currently a Junior at Lexington High school, where I am a part of the Varsity Swim Team.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>My two main interests are mountain biking and computer programming. What I love most about the two is the satisfaction that you get after finally completing a goal that you work towards for a long time, whether it be hitting a jump after spending weeks building it, or finally getting a complicated algorithm to run.</p>

    <h2>What I can do</h2>
    <p>As for programming languages, I know some C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and am able to use Matlab. I am always willing to learn new languages or how to use new libraries.</p>
