    <p>During this experiment, I rode my bmx bike on asphalt, sidewalk, and down my backyard and recorded the accelerometer values. For the analysis, I focused on observing the amount of bumpiness in each of the three trials.</p>

    <p>During this experiment, I recorded the accelerometer values while bunnyhopping and going over a small plastic ramp. For the analysis, I focused on detecting jumps and smoothing data.</p>
